Variable,Meaning
SpeciesAuthor,Species name used in the original study. Number at the end refers to studies that use the same specific epithet.
OrganismType,"Plant type. Values: ""Herbaceous perennial"", ""Shrub"", ""Succulent"", ""Fern"", ""Tree"""
DicotMonoc,"Dicot or Monocot species. Values: ""Monocot"", ""Eudicot"""
AngioGymno,"Angiosperm or Gymnosperm species? Value: ""Angiosperm"", ""Gymno"""
graminoid,"Is this a graminoid species or not? Values: ""yes"", ""no"""
MatrixPopulation,Population to which the log_lambda values refer to. Combining MatrixPopulation to SpeciesAuthor provides the 162 populations that make up the dataset
MatrixTreatment,"Treatment (if any) associated with each log_lambda values. Treatments can refer to either experimental manipulations, or to observational conditions (e.g. habitat conditions)"
MatrixReplicate,"Spatial replicates nested within MatrixPopulation. These replicates are assumed to be separate populations (e.g. not connected by dispersal), but they do not have separate coordinates (Lat/Lon)."
Lat,Latitude referred to each MatrixPopulation
Lon,Longitude referred to each MatrixPopulation
ppt_mean,Mean annual precipitation at each MatrixPopulation
ppt_sd,Standard deviation of annual precipitation at ech MatrixPopulation
tmp_mean,Mean annual temperature at each MatrixPopulation
tmp_sd,Standard deviation of annual temperature at ech MatrixPopulation
spp_pop,"Combination of ""SpeciesAuthor"" and ""MatrixPopulation"". This is variable to facilitate analyses."
spp_rep,"Combination of ""SpeciesAuthor"" and ""MatrixReplicate"". This is variable to facilitate analyses."
MatrixStartYear,Starting year of the demographic transition log_lambda refers to. E.g. when log_lambda = 0 corresponds to MatrixStartYear 1998 means that the asymptotic population growth rate of the population implied no change in population numbers between 1998 and 1999.
MatrixEndYear,Ending year of the demographic transition log_lambda refers to. E.g. when log_lambda = 0 corresponds to MatrixEndYear == 1999 means that the asymptotic population growth rate of the population implied no change in population numbers between 1998 and 1999.
cov,"Covariate, if any, associated with each matrix. The covariate can be either continuous or categorical."
cov2,"Second covariate, if any, associated with each matrix."
type,"Type of covariate, if any. Value: ""continuous"", ""discrete"", ""continuous; discrete"""
levels,Number of levels for categorical covariates
cov_n,"Number of covariates associated with each study. Values: ""1"", ""2"""
ppt_t0,Annual precipitation anomaly (z-score) observed between MatrixStartYear and MatrixEndYear
tmp_t0,Annual temperature anomaly (z-score) observed between MatrixStartYear and MatrixEndYear
log_lambda,"log of lambda (asymptotic population growth rate) referred to each unique combination of SpeciesAuthor, MatrixPopulation, and MatrixStartYear (or MatrixEndYear)."
