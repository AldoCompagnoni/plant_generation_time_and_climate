# Analyses and data for "Herbaceous perennial plants with short generation time have stronger responses to climate anomalies than those with longer generation time"

This repository provides the data and code to run the analyses of the article "Herbaceous perennial plants with short generation time have stronger responses to climate anomalies than those with longer generation time".

1. Data and metadata files are contained in the `data` directory.

2. The file `wrapper.R` runs all analyses by sourcing the scripts in the `R` directory. Make sure to run the `wrapper.R` after opening the `plant_generation_time_and_climate.Rproj` file.

3. The pdf files in the main directory contain bivariate plots, and associated linear models, that link log(lambda) values to annual precipitation and temperature anomalies for each of the 162 populations contained in the study. These pdf files will be re-produced and overwritten when running the `wrapper.R` file.
